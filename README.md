#### 1. Overview of the Analysis

  V. Isualize gave Omar and I an assignment to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. We will be utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
  
#### 2. Results

**Total rides**

The total ride count is the highest in the urban city type at 1,625 rides. There were 625 rides in the suburban areas and 125 in the rural areas.

**Total drivers**

The total amount of drivers is the highest in the urban city type at 2,405 drivers. There were 490 drivers in the suburban areas and 78 drivers in the rural areas.

**Total fares**

The total amount of fares from all city types combined is $63,538.64.

**Average fare per ride**

The average fare per ride is highest in the rural city type at $34.62. The average fare per ride in the suburban area is $30.97 and in the urban area is $24.53.

**Average fare per driver**

The average fare per driver is highest in the rural city type at $55.49. The average fare per driver in the suburban area is $39.50 and in the urban area is $16.57.

**Total fare by city type**

The total fare amount is the highest in the urban city type at $39,854.38. The total in the suburban area is $19,356.33 and in the rural is $4,327.93.

- According to our analysis we notice a few things. We notice that there is a huge disparity in the amount of drivers between all three city types. There are 2,405 drivers in the urbans and 78 drivers in the rural. The difference in these numbers make it difficult to compare the rest of the data accurately.
- Due to the difference in drivers, there is also going to be a huge disparity in the total ride count from city type to city type. There was a total of 1,625 rides given in the urbans compared to the 125 give in the rural within the time frame according to the graph above. It is possible there could be more rides given in the rural areas if there were more drivers present.
- The average fare per driver in the rural areas is $55.49 and the average fare per driver in the urban areas is 16.57. The average fare per ride in the rural area is $34.62 and the average fare per ride in the urban area is $24.53. This disparity seems apparent due to there being significantly less drivers available and less rides given in the rural areas. The demand in the rural areas is much higher for more drivers because the average fare per ride has a $10 difference but per driver shows a $40 difference. We once again come to the conclusion that we need more drivers present in rural areas.
